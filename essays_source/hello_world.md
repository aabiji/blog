# Hello world \!

This is the first actual article that I'm publishing to this site.
 Sort of like a little test to see if everything works correctly without bugs.

---

There's a huge chance that I don't blog at all, since I don't have very interesting things to say
 and imposter syndrome is a thing,
 but in terms of building the blog itself \( the site and the blog engine \), I'm glad I did it, since
 it's been a project I've been wanting to build for a while.
 However, if I do happen to write an article, it'll either be about thoughts I have on a
 specific subject or just a writeup on a project I built. Personaly, I think it would be a
 pretty nice way of revisiting a past project, reading up on how I initially built it
 in the first place.

I'm not a genius, or in a position to have an opinion on anything really, so you should take
 what I write with a grain of salt.
 Writing this, I also know that the probability of someone else reading this is slim to none,
 but if you happen to be reading this, I hope you have a good rest of your day.

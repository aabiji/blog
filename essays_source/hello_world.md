# Hello world

There's a certain magic that follows, examining your first line of code. 
That feeling of magic, of endless possibilites never leaves as you write your 
hundredth, thousandth, heck millioneth. For me, I feel a more subtle feeling of 
magic as I sit here writing this essay, keeping in mind the potential Pandora's box 
I open for myself. Knowing that maybe, just maybe, people will read this and have 
thoughts and opinions on what I'm writing, negative or positive. 
Even though, deep down inside I wnat this blog to 
be a more personal and heartfelt medium. So why publish this publicly? 

Valid or not, I have a couple of reasons. The first is to document the things I build.
Documentation seems like the boring last part of a project's development cycle, but 
I realize now that it's important because it makes you view your project from an outsider's 
perspective. It makes you revisit and question your architectural decisions, not just in 
the design of a piece of software, but how the design is implemented as well in the code. 
You might realize that hey, you wrote something one way, but now that you think 
about it, here's a much simpler way to write it that covers most if not all the edge cases. 
Of course that's not always the case, but I think going back and reflecting on what 
you built is quite beneficial. But then why not 
just document privately in a journal? Because of the value it could potentially give people.  
Taking inspiration from other blogs, I feel that maybe someone out there will read my 
thoughts on a program I wrote and take inspiration to build that same thing. Or maybe just 
share my enthusiam for something I find interesting.

The second is to think better, or to put it differently better develop my thoughts. 
Inspired by Paul Graham's [The need to read](http://www.paulgraham.com/read.html),  
I suppose that putting my ideas and thoughts into words  
forces me to better understand them. Writing more than one sentence to explain what I'm thinking 
about and trying to explain myself as if I'm talking to a five year old prompts me to better  
flesh out my thoughts. Forcing me to not only understand what's on the surface, but to 
understand what it is I'm writing about on a deeper level. Also, doing more of something 
naturally makes you better at that thing, so in writing more, I hope to get better at writing.

So in light of all this, writing my first article, 

*** Hello world ***

# Thoughts for this year

As the year begins, I'd like to list a few things I'd like to do, 
and things I'd like to learn. Like new year resolutions often are 
never fully accomplished, I not taking this too seriously, rather 
using this as a very vague "guide".

Books I would like to revisit/read  
My favorites:
- Ready Player One \(Epic book!\)5
- Hunger Games Trilogy \(I think it's a interesting thing, pondering over the deeper philosophical meaning behind a lot of the events in the book.\)
- New favorite books?

Reading list:
- The Art of War
- War and Peace
- Dune \( Maybe not the trilogy, but at least the first book \)

In general:
- I think in general just reading \(or watching ComputerPhile\) about computer science and software engineering to expand the scope of my knowledge


Things I would like to learn:
- Getting more comfortable in Rust \(as comfortable as I am in Python or in C\)
- Learning more about cryptography and encryption \(RSA, public key encryption, etc.\)
- More web stuff \- Wasm and Webassembly seem interesting
- Unit testing \- testing code in general
- Scala???, Arch linux??? \(I use Mint and Gnome by the way \)
- Anything and everything I find interesting in the moment


Things I would like to build:
- Make [mark](https://github.com/aabiji/mark) more robut \- maybe working on token escaping.
- RSS feed reader \( I actually need this \)
- A package manager \( Not to dethrone existing ones, but to see how it could be built \)
- A NES emulator \(  But can it run in Doom ??? \)
- Advent of code \( Ok, not something you build, but I really need to get better at algorithms and data structures \)
- A Lisp compiler
- MNIST from scratch in C
- A Doom port would be interesting
- Some sort of game \( game jam?? \)
- Obsidian, but for shower thoughts \( also a lot scaled down \)
- Some sort of twitter bot \( oh the chaos\! \)
- Adblocker ultimate, but open source
- Vscode, but with a Tauri backend instead of Electron
- A toy operating system \( Not the next linux, just for learning purposes \)
- Mobile app???
- Serenity OS contributions??


What I've listed will definately change over the year, but I think it'll be interesting going back 
and seeing what I've actually done and how I've progressed.

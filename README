My blog
-------
Source code for the blog's frontned (hosted on Github pages) 
and the cli program I use to publish blog articles ( engine/ ).
This source code for this project is custom, made specifically to 
manage my blog, but the code should be pretty easy to modify for 
your own purposes if you want.

The essays are under the creative commons liscense, while the source
code is under the MIT liscense.

P.S: In engine/ , I included a submodule for https://github.com/aabiji/mark.
So make sure to clone recusively.

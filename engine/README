The blog engine
---------------
A command line utily that gives you the ability to create, delete and 
update blog articles.
This is custom, made specifically for my blog, but feel free to clone and 
modify the source if you want.

How it works
------------
index.html contains a projects and content div.
When you execute engine.py, engine.py checks if 
you've create any new github repos and will update the projects
div accordingly.
The content div is treated as a sort of ciruclar buffer and 
it's updated when you "feature" a blog article.

archive.html contains a content div. When you create or delete a blog article
the <div id="article"> associated to it is updated accordingly. When you update 
a blog article, the <p id="date"/> inside the <div id="article"> is updated to match 
the date you updated the article.

Creating a new blog article create a key (hash of the title and current date) to the 
value of metadata about the article in the json database. The hash is used to identify 
blog articles.
Example: "foiaj38r892qu83jf8jaij98": {"date": "dd-mm-yyyy", "title":"", "path":""}
It also creates a new html file given a template (assets/_template_.html).

To render codeblocks, highlight.js is also linked as a cdn asset.

Create a new blog article: blog new FILENAME TITLE
(the title argument is optional)

Delete a blog article: blog delete BLOG_HASH

Feature a blog article: blog feature BLOG_HASH

List blogs: blog list
Example output:
HASH  ->  (TITLE, DATE, PATH)

                Hello world !
            </h1>
            <p>
                This is the first actual article that I'm publishing to this site.
                Sort of like a little test to see if everything works correctly without bugs.
            </p>

                There's a huge chance that I don't blog at all, since I don't have very interesting things to say
                and imposter syndrome is a thing,
                but in terms of building the blog itself ( the site and the blog engine ), I'm glad I did it, since
                it's been a project I've been wanting to build for a while.
                However, if I do happen to write an article, it'll either be about thoughts I have on a
                specific subject or just a writeup on a project I built. Personaly, I think it would be a
                pretty nice way of revisiting a past project, reading up on how I initially built it
                in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not a genius, or in a position to have an opinion on anything really, so you should take
                what I write with a grain of salt.
                Writing this, I also know that the probability of someone else reading this is slim to none,
                but if you happen to be reading this, I hope you have a good rest of your day.
